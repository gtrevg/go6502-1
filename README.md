A [go][golang]-based emulator for the [6502][6502]-based
[pda6502 homebrew computer][pda6502].


Background
----------

This started as a golang port of my [very incomplete Ruby 6502/6510/c64
emulator][c64.rb].

Since then, I've started working on an actual [6502-based homebrew
computer][pda6502], including designing the address decoder, RAM/ROM/IO memory
layout etc.

go6502 has become the emulator for that system, but has a flexible address
bus which could be repurposed to other 6502-based systems.


Running it
----------

Set up Go:

* `brew install go` / `aptitude install golang` / whatever.
* Spend a few days making sense of, fighting against, and eventually
  tollerating the golang directory structure as described at
  http://golang.org/doc/code.html
* Set your `$GOPATH` the way Go wants you to, e.g. `$HOME/code/go`.
* Put Go's bin dir in your path, e.g. `$HOME/code/go/bin`

Get and run go6502:

* Drop an 8 KB `kernal.rom` into `$PWD/rom/`, where ever that may be.
    * ([pda6502][pda6502] can help; see `memory.conf` and `Makefile`)
* `go get github.com/pda/go6502`
* `go6502`
* `go6502 --help`
* `go6502 --debug`
